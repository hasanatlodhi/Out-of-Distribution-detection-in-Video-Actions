                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                  In recent years, action recognition in videos has gained significant attention due to its
applications in various fields such as video surveillance, human-computer interaction, and
sports analysis. However, a key challenge in action recognition is the ability to detect and
classify actions that are unseen during training, known as out-of-distribution (OOD) actions.
This blog explores our journey in developing "Actions.ai," a website that utilizes I3D models
and novel loss functions to enhance action recognition and OOD detection capabilities.

                <h2>Understanding the Problem:</h2>
                <p>
                  Action recognition involves identifying and classifying specific actions or activities within a
                  video. Traditional approaches often rely on handcrafted features and shallow models, which
                  may struggle to capture the rich temporal dynamics and spatial information present in videos.
                  To overcome these limitations, we turned to deep learning techniques, particularly
                  convolutional neural network (CNN) models.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h2>Dataset Selection and Preprocessing:</h2>
                <p>
                  To train and evaluate our model, we employed the UCF101 dataset, which consists of 101
action categories in a diverse range of videos. This dataset offered a suitable variety of actions
to ensure comprehensive training and testing of our system. We performed necessary data
preprocessing steps, including video resizing, frame extraction, and temporal sampling, to
prepare the data for training.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div><h2>Video Classification:</h2>
              <p>
                Video classification is a challenging task due to the temporal nature of video data. Traditional
image classification techniques are insufficient for video classification since they overlook the
temporal dependencies between frames. To overcome this limitation, researchers have
developed various deep learning architectures that capture temporal information effectively.
CNNs, popularly known for their success in image classification, have also been adapted for
video classification by incorporating temporal modeling.

              </p></div>

              <div>
                <h2>Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Detection:</h2>
                <p>
                  While accurate action recognition is essential, it is equally critical to detect actions that do not
belong to the known set of classes. Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection plays a vital role in
ensuring the reliability and safety of action recognition systems. OOD actions, also known as
unseen actions, are actions that the model has not been trained on. Detecting and flagging these
OOD actions helps prevent misclassifications or erroneous predictions.

                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h2>Using CNN Models</h2>
                <p>
                  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have revolutionized the field of computer vision.
They excel in capturing spatial features from images, making them a valuable asset for video
classification. In the context of video processing, CNNs are extended to handle 3D data by
considering both spatial and temporal dimensions. These 3D CNNs extract spatio-temporal
features from video frames and learn hierarchical representations, enabling accurate action
recognition.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h2>Initial Challenges and the Shift to I3D Models:</h2>
                <p>
                  While CNN models showed promise, we encountered suboptimal results in action recognition
and OOD detection. It became evident that the temporal aspect of actions was not being
effectively captured. This led us to explore the Inflated 3D ConvNet (I3D), which extends
CNNs to process 3D convolutional kernels and learn both spatial and temporal features
simultaneously.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h2>Utilizing I3D for Feature Extraction:</h2>
                <p>
                  To leverage the power of I3D, we incorporated it into our pipeline as a feature extractor. The
I3D model is pretrained on large-scale video datasets (e.g., Kinetics) and can be fine-tuned on
our specific action recognition task. By extracting features from video frames, we obtained a
more robust representation that encapsulates both spatial and temporal characteristics of
actions.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h2>Loss Functions for Separating Seen and Unseen Actions:</h2>
                <p>
                  To tackle the challenge of OOD detection, we explored novel loss functions that encourage the
model to distinguish between seen and unseen actions. One approach we adopted was the
confidence-based loss function, which assigned higher confidence values to seen actions and
lower confidence values to unseen actions. This helped create a clear separation between the
two categories, enabling accurate identification and classification.

                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h2>Results and Performance Evaluation:</h2>
                <p>
                  The integration of I3D models and novel loss functions yielded significant improvements in
action recognition and OOD detection. Through rigorous experimentation and evaluation, we
observed higher accuracy in identifying both seen and unseen actions. The use of I3D models
allowed for more accurate temporal modeling, leading to improved recognition performance.
The confidence-based loss function further enhanced the model's ability to differentiate
between seen and unseen actions.

              <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
              In this blog, we explored our journey in developing "Actions.ai," a website dedicated to action
              recognition and OOD detection. By leveraging the power of I3D models and employing novel
